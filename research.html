  <section>
    <p>
      My research draws on tools from probability theory, stochastic processes, statistical mechanics, non-equilibrium thermodynamics, and machine learning to construct computationally efficient and physically grounded models of complex systems. I am particularly interested in intelligent model reduction within multiscale settings, where the goal is to identify and extract the essential structures present in high-resolution data&mdash;whether from experiments, theory, or simulation&mdash;and encode them into a reduced description that remains predictive while dramatically simplifying computation.
